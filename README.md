BorderWaitWatcher
=================

A simple Android app to quickly see wait times on key border crossing in Michigan, Ontario, and New York.

The app uses scrapping to acquire this information from the Canadian and American border service websites.

I built this app to give me instant border wait times for particular crossings in Ontario, Michigan, and New York that
were of interest to me. It would be fairly trivial to extend this app to cover the crossings you are interested in,
or better yet allow the user to configure which crossings get displayed.
